## Notes

- Due to time and environment limitations, some deployment steps were simulated or described rather than fully automated.  
- All JQ queries were tested using jqplay.org and with real JSON data from Kubernetes and Jira.  
- Kubernetes Minikube was not fully available locally, so the setup was demonstrated conceptually with Helm commands and expected configuration.  
- The submission aims to fulfill all requirements within the assignment constraints.
